# Rbasics
Introduction to using R and Rstudio

# Orientation to the files in this repository

1. .Rmd are the source files used to generate the other files. R Markdown is used to embed R code with other text and to format the results as desired.
2. .md files are formatted to be viewed on GitHub
3. .html files are formatted so they can be viewed as slideshows in the browser. Clicking on the .html file shows the underlying html syntax. To view the html files as presentations in your browser, go to [https://htmlpreview.github.io/](https://htmlpreview.github.io/)
4. .R files contain just the R syntax used in the examples, without any of the added text content.
